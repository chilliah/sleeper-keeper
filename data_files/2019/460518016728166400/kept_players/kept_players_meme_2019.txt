In the year of 2019, a forgotten age before masks, our glorious commissioner Andjita had a dream to reforge the long forgotten Yet Another Fantasy League. 
He set out on a task to recruit the most dedicated and ruthless fantasy owners. 
Once he had assembled his fantasy avengers, it was time for the greatest crossover event in all of fantasy football. 
YAFL 2.0 was born.

This was the first year of the league. No one was kept. Hey remember when we did that snake draft?
